#Intro
For this project, you will build a content and comment web app. 
Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on 
their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. 
Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Why this project?
This content and comment structure is 
common across a large number of websites and 
applications, from news sites to blogs to aggregators like 
Hacker News and Reddit. By building this project, you will gain an 
understanding of how Redux can function in a standard type of application.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Specification
You will start with a local backend development server. 
The server is built in Node, but it is very simple. You won't need to edit the server code; 
instead, your code will talk to the server using documented API endpoints. 
You can use the server's endpoints to manage storing, reading, updating, and deleting data 
for your application.

Using this server, you will build a React/Redux front end for the application. 
The specification provided below is the minimum required for this project. 
You may extend your project however you like, however, as long as the minimum specification 
is met.
